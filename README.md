# Spam-Classifier
A simple spam classifier, to detect spam emails from non-spam(ham) on [Apache SpamAssassine](http://spamassassin.apache.org/) dataset. <br>
the same approach could be used to classify spams in others languages as well, but some language specific libraries for preprocessesing will be needed (like HAZM for Persian)
